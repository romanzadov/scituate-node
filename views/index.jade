    What times do you think you'll be in Scituate? You don't have to be 100% sure, I'm just trying to get a ballpark figure. If you think there's more than a 50% chance, say yes.<br> To avoid kitchen conflicts, click on when you want to cook. You don't have to cook - you can bring something - or even better just bring yourself.
